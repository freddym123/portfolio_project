      <p className="about">Hello! My name is Freddy and I enjoy creating applications. My interest in programming started in my last year of high school. I didn't know what I wanted to do after high school but luckily, I was introduced to python in a after school program I would attend. I would then learn more languages like C and C++ and Javascript. From then on I started to program and learn new things almost everyday.</p>
      <p className="about">
        Fast-forward to today, I have been fortunate enough to be attending a University where I am pursuing a Bachelor degree in computer science. Some of the things I like to do when I am not programming are playing sports with friends such as soccer and basketball, playing video games, and much more.
